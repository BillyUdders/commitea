# AGENTS Instructions

Welcome! This repository did not previously contain any agent-specific guidance. These are some lightweight reminders for future agents working here:

- Always read the system, developer, and user messages carefully before acting.
- Search the repository for other `AGENTS.md` files before editing files in new directories.
- After making changes, run the relevant Go tests with `go test ./...` whenever feasible.
- Ensure the working tree is clean and all checks pass before finishing a task.
